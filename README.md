# Workday Scheduler 

  ## Description

  This is a simple hour by hour planner, that could be used in a work, school, or home setting. A user can add text entries to the time block desired, which are saved in local storage. The time blocks are color coded in grey, red, and green to indicate past, present, and future status respectively.

  ## Acknowledgments
  This project was one of my homework assignments from the fullstack bootcamp provided by Trilogy Education.
  I was given starter code for both the HTML and CSS. My assignment was to build out the JS portion of the application.
  * It uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons, which is free and open-source.
  * For a framework, it uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), which is also free and open-source. 
  * To deal with the date and time aspect, I used the popular [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), which is (you guessed it) free, and open-source.
  * As always, [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) contained a wealth of information that helped me learn while I worked on this assignment.
